// This file is used to generate the Hive adapters for the Group models
// Run this command to generate the adapters:
// flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

// The generated files will be:
// - lib/models/group.g.dart

// Make sure to add the following to your pubspec.yaml:
// dependencies:
//   hive: ^[version]
//   hive_flutter: ^[version]
// dev_dependencies:
//   build_runner: ^[version]
//   hive_generator: ^[version]

// This file doesn't need to be imported anywhere, it's just a reminder
// of how to generate the adapters for the Group models.

// After generating the adapters, make sure to register them in the
// GroupService.initializeGroupBoxes() method.

// The models that need adapters are:
// - Group (typeId: 5)
// - GroupAmalan (typeId: 6)
// - GroupMemberProgress (typeId: 7)
// - GroupInvitation (typeId: 8)

// Make sure these typeIds don't conflict with any existing typeIds in your app.
